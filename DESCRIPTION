Title: Toda-Yamamoto Granger Causality Tests with Network Graph Visualization
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Your", "Name", email = "your.email@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A package that implements Toda-Yamamoto causality test and visualizes the results using network graph visualization.
    The Toda-Yamamoto approach (Toda & Yamamoto, 1995) overcomes issues that can arise when testing non-stationary time series
    for causality relationships. This package provides tools to analyze time series data for causality relationships and
    creates network visualizations using the igraph package.
